# 📘 Q&A PDF Assistant with RAG + Agents 🤖📄  

This project is proudly developed by **Asad Shabir (AI Engineer)**.  
It is a **Question-Answering Assistant** built with **Chainlit, OpenAI, RAG, and Web Search**.  
The assistant can read a **PDF file with 100+ Q&A pairs**, generate embeddings, and answer questions directly.  
If no good answer is found in the PDF, it falls back to **LLM + Web Search**.

## ✨ Features  
- 📄 **PDF Knowledge Base (RAG)** – Loads Q&A from `questions_100.pdf` and answers from it.  
- 🤖 **Summarize Agent** – Provides concise answers in English or Urdu.  
- 🌍 **Web Search Tool** – Falls back to web search when the answer is not in PDF.  
- 💬 **General Chat** – Handles greetings, small talk, and casual conversation.  
- 🎯 **Starters** – Quick start options (Ask Question, General Chat, Help).  
- 🔎 **Smart Matching** – Finds the best answer based on embeddings similarity.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Load PDF** → Extracts Q&A pairs from the document.  
2. **Embed Questions** → Generates vector embeddings for all questions.  
3. **User Query** → Finds similarity with stored Q&A.  
   - ✅ If found → Answer directly from PDF.  
   - ❌ If not found → Uses **LLM + Web Search** agent.  
4. **Response** → Friendly and clear answers, with emoji support.
